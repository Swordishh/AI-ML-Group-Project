# Tornado Prediction with Linear Regression

Uses Sci-kit Learn modules to train and test data with both linear and polynomial regression, and comparing the two to decide on a more accurate model

matplotlib for clear and concise graphs of the data as output, 
and sklearn to implement the regression models
