# Tornado Prediction with Linear Regression

Uses Sci-kit Learn modules to train and test data with both linear and polynomial regression, and comparing the two to decide on a more accurate model

Necessary imports are pandas for dataset manipulation, 
matplotlib for clear and concise graphs of the data as output, 
and sklearn to implement the regression models

- Has some issues running on VSCode due to it thinking the necessary datafiles aren't included, however when run with PyCharm it executes fine
